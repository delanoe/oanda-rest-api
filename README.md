# oanda-rest-api

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdreaver/oanda-rest-api.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jdreaver/oanda-rest-api)

This library implements a Haskell client to the
[OANDA v20 REST API](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/).

## Status

Right now the only methods I have implemented are the ones I currently use.
Feel free to make a PR or open an issue if there is a missing API endpoint that
you need.
